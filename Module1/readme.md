<b>Module 1: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Optimization</b>

At the end of this learning module,  the students should be able to:
1. Analyze the concepts of computational thinking in solving real-world problems.
2. Demonstrate how to use different optimization techniques such as greedy and brute force to solve optimization problems.
3. Compare recursion from dynamic programming.
4. Apply the concepts of graphs to solve shortest path related problems.

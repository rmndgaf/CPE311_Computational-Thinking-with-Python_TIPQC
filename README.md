*Details/Disclaimer: This repository is meant for the course CPE311 Computational Thinking with Python, offered at the Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City.*

## Objectives
The course introduces students to the principles of computational thinking as a way of solving problems, designing systems, developing algorithms, and understanding human behavior. This course explores making use of different levels of abstraction, decomposition, modularization, and recursion to understand and solve problems more effectively. It uses
mathematical concepts such as induction, to develop algorithms and produce more efficient, fair, elegant, and secure solutions. The object-oriented language, Python, will be used to demonstrate computationally thinking of students by solving real-life problems
